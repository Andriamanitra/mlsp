# Âµlsp

LSP client for [micro-editor](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro). Note that this
is work in progress and currently **extremely buggy**, even the basic features
don't work properly yet. Use at your own risk.

[AndCake/micro-plugin-lsp](https://github.com/AndCake/micro-plugin-lsp) is a
slightly more complete LSP client for micro.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your micro plugins directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/Andriamanitra/mlsp ~/.config/micro/plug/mlsp
```

The plugin currently provides three commands:

- `lsp "deno lsp"` (the quotes are required when the command takes arguments)
  starts a language server by executing command `deno lsp`. Without arguments
  the `lsp` command will try to guess the right server by looking at the
  currently open filetype.
- `lsp-stop "deno lsp"` stops the `deno lsp` language server. Without arguments
  the `lsp-stop` command will stop _all_ currently running language servers.
- `hover` shows hover information for the code under cursor
- `format` formats the buffer that is currently open

You can type the commands on micro command prompt or bind them to keys by adding
something like this to your `bindings.json`:

```json
{
  "F7": "command:lsp",
  "F8": "command:format",
  "Ctrl-j": "command:hover"
}
```

## Supported features

- [x] get hover information
- [x] format document
- [ ] format selection
- [ ] everything else

## Known issues

- When using multiple language servers at the same time there is no good way to
  handle which one handles which request. So if you start both
  `pyright-language-server --stdio` and `ruff-lsp` and then ask for hover
  information you may get the result from either one (depending on which one is
  slower to respond) even though only Pyright responded with something useful.
